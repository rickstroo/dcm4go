# dcm4go

dcm4go is an implementation of a DICOM library and some DICOM tools using the Go language.  Mostly, it's an exercise in learning how to use Go.  I think this is now my 4th DICOM library that I've implemented as a method to learn a new language.

## Getting Started

Download the code.  Run the generator.  Copy the generated Go files to the library folder.  Build the library.  Build the tools.  More detailed explanations will come eventually.

### Prerequisites

A development environment for Go.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With

dcm4go was built using the Atom IDE and the go-plus and go-debug plugins.

## Contributing

At this time, I'm not accepting contributions.  If this project becomes useful to a larger community at some point, we will revisit.

## Versioning

At this time, we're not versioning.  The develop branch is where development happens.  At points in time when we've developed useful functionality, we'll merge with master.
